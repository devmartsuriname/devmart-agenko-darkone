# Restore Point: A12.6 — Hero CTA Admin Alignment

**Created:** 2025-12-19
**Phase:** A12.6

---

## Problem Statement

CTA fields (`cta_text`, `cta_link`) exist in the Admin Hero form but are NOT rendered in the public Zivan Hero component. This creates a user experience mismatch — admins can edit fields that have no visible effect on the public site.

---

## Decision

**Option A (selected):** Hide CTA fields from the Admin Hero form UI completely.

**Rationale:**
- Zivan public Hero has no CTA — maintaining 1:1 parity is non-negotiable
- Hiding (not deleting) preserves DB schema for future re-enabling
- Cleaner admin UX — no confusing orphan fields
- Darkone UI remains 1:1

---

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `apps/admin/src/app/(admin)/content/hero/components/HeroForm.tsx` | Remove CTA inputs from UI, remove from default values/reset, omit from onSubmit payload |

---

## Data Safety

**Critical requirement:** When editing an existing hero, DO NOT overwrite existing `cta_text`/`cta_link` in DB with null.

**Solution:** `onSubmit` payload **omits** `cta_text` and `cta_link` keys entirely (not set to null), so existing DB values remain unchanged.

---

## Rollback Steps

1. Restore `apps/admin/src/app/(admin)/content/hero/components/HeroForm.tsx` from this commit
2. Re-add CTA fields to:
   - Zod schema (already present, not removed)
   - Form default values (lines 102-103)
   - Reset logic (lines 119-120, 133-134)
   - onSubmit payload (lines 152-153)
   - UI inputs (lines 251-280)

---

## What Was NOT Changed

- Database schema (`hero_sections` table)
- RLS policies
- Public Hero component (`apps/public/src/components/Hero/index.jsx`)
- Darkone styling or components
- Zod schema (CTA fields remain for validation flexibility)
