# Restore Point: A12.2 Public Hero Wiring (Documentation Only)

**Created:** 2025-12-18  
**Phase:** A12.2 — Public Hero Wiring Plan  
**Scope:** Documentation ONLY (no code changes)

---

## Purpose

Create documentation plan for wiring the public Zivan homepage Hero to Supabase `hero_sections` table.

---

## Files to CREATE

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/plan/A12.2_PublicHeroWiring_Plan.md` | Detailed wiring plan with data mapping, fetch strategy, fallback logic |

## Files to UPDATE

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `docs/backend.md` | Add A12.2 as "Documented / Code-reviewed wiring" |
| `docs/architecture.md` | Add A12.2 as "Documented / Code-reviewed wiring" |

---

## Non-Negotiables

1. **NO code changes** — only documentation files
2. **Zivan 1:1 lock** — no UI/markup changes proposed
3. **Darkone 1:1 lock** — no admin UI changes
4. **Status wording:** "Documented / Code-reviewed wiring" (NOT "Complete")

---

## Code Review Summary (from prior analysis)

The following wiring already exists in code (code-reviewed, not runtime verified):

| Component | File | Observation |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Home page | `apps/public/src/components/Pages/Home.jsx` | Calls `useHeroSections()` hook |
| Hero component | `apps/public/src/components/Hero/index.jsx` | Accepts `title`, `subtitle`, `videoSrc`, `bgUrl` props |
| Hook | `apps/public/src/hooks/useContent.js` | `useHeroSections()` queries `hero_sections` table |

### Mapped Fields (code-reviewed)

| DB Field | Hero Prop | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| `heading` | `title` (wrapped in array) | ✅ Mapped |
| `subheading` | `subtitle` | ✅ Mapped |
| `background_video_url` | `videoSrc` | ✅ Mapped |
| `background_image_url` | `bgUrl` | ✅ Mapped |

### Unmapped Fields (DEFERRED — would require UI changes)

| DB Field | Status | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| `cta_text` | ⚠️ NOT mapped | Hero component has no CTA button; adding would break Zivan 1:1 |
| `cta_link` | ⚠️ NOT mapped | Hero component has no CTA button; adding would break Zivan 1:1 |
| `overlay_opacity` | ⚠️ NOT mapped | No CSS variable wiring in current Hero markup |
| `text_alignment` | ⚠️ NOT mapped | Fixed alignment in current Hero markup |

---

## Rollback

If any error occurs, delete the created documentation files and revert updates to `backend.md` and `architecture.md`.
