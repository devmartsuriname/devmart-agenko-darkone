# Decision Memo: A12.4 — Admin Structure Decision

**Date:** 2025-12-19  
**Status:** Documentation Only — NO Implementation  
**Author:** AI Assistant

---

## Executive Summary

This document formally recommends the future Admin navigation structure for section editing capabilities. **No implementation is performed in this phase.**

---

## Context

### Current State
- "Hero Sections" CRUD exists under **Content** menu group
- Path: `/content/hero`
- Menu structure: `Content → Hero Sections`

### Problem
- As more section types are added (CTA, Stats, About blocks, etc.), the Content menu will become bloated
- "Content" semantically refers to pages, posts, services — not UI layout sections
- Mixing content items with UI/layout sections creates confusion

---

## Options Analysis

### Option 1: Keep Section Editing Under "Content" (Status Quo)

**Description:**  
Keep Hero Sections and future section modules under the existing Content menu group.

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Pros** | • No migration required |
|          | • Familiar pattern for current users |
|          | • No menu restructuring |
| **Cons** | • Bloats Content menu as sections grow |
|          | • Semantic confusion (content vs. UI sections) |
|          | • Scalability issues (10+ items in one menu) |
| **Migration Impact** | None |
| **Risk Level** | **Medium** — Acceptable short-term, problematic long-term |

---

### Option 2: Create "Frontend / Sections" as Separate Top-Level Nav Group (RECOMMENDED)

**Description:**  
Create a new top-level navigation group called "Frontend" (or "Sections") to house all UI/layout section editing modules.

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Pros** | • Clear separation of concerns |
|          | • Scalable — can add Home, About, Contact sections cleanly |
|          | • Semantic clarity — "Frontend" = public UI appearance |
|          | • Keeps "Content" focused on pages/posts/services |
| **Cons** | • Requires migration of Hero Sections |
|          | • Adds one new menu group |
|          | • Needs icon selection from Darkone library |
| **Migration Impact** | 1 module to move (Hero Sections) |
| **Risk Level** | **Low** — Clean separation, minor migration |

---

## Recommendation

### ✅ Option 2: Create "Frontend / Sections" as Separate Top-Level Nav Group

**Reason:**  
This approach provides clear architectural separation between:
- **Content** = Data-driven items (pages, posts, services, projects, team, etc.)
- **Frontend** = UI/layout sections (Hero, CTA, Stats, About blocks, etc.)

This is the **future direction** but is **NOT implemented in this phase**.

---

## Future Implementation Details (Planning Only)

### Navigation Placement (When Implemented)
- **Group Name:** "Frontend" or "Sections"
- **Position:** Above "System" section, below "Marketing"
- **Icon Reference:** `mingcute:layout-line` (from Darkone icon set)

### Module Naming Convention (Proposed)
```
Frontend
├── Home Sections
│   ├── Hero
│   ├── Stats / Fun Facts
│   ├── CTA
│   └── About Preview
├── About Sections
│   ├── About Block 1
│   ├── About Block 2
│   └── How We Work
└── Contact Sections
    └── Contact Info
```

### Migration Plan (Incremental — When Approved)
1. **Step 1:** Create "Frontend" menu group with icon
2. **Step 2:** Move Hero Sections from Content → Frontend
3. **Step 3:** Verify all links, RBAC, and functionality
4. **Rollback:** Revert menu item location if issues arise
